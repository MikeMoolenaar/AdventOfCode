- Solve time: ?

Oof I had a lot of trouble with part 1, just understanding the rules was quite hard. Next time I need to add debug lines earlier so I can compare these lines with the example shown in the assignment.   
Did part 2 with the help of reddit, again couldn't figure it out myself, though I did program the solution without help. The program finished in 176ms.  

I did learn how to use a queue for the first time, it works really nicely with a while loop.
