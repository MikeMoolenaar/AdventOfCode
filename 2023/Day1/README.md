- Time to solve: 30m

Spent too much time trying to solve this using regex and couldn't figure it out. I do like my solution, the if-else is ugly, but it works well.

@encse has a [really nice solution](https://github.com/encse/adventofcode/blob/master/2023/Day01/Solution.cs) that uses regex and the switch case to convert the strings and numbers, which I should have done. Also he uses `RegexOptions.RightToLeft` which I didn't know.
