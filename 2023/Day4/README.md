# Day 4

What the hell this was WAY easier than day 3, will this cycle of hard then easy problems continue?  
Had a little bit of trouble with part 2, got quite confused about the whole repeating of cards, should have used a dictionary earlier on with the game ID as the key. Happy with the result!

meshcheryakov83 used `StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries` in [his solution](https://github.com/meshcheryakov83/advent-of-code/blob/master/2023/dec04/Program.cs) which I forgot about, makes it a bit cleaner.
