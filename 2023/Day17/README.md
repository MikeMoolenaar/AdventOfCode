- Solve time: too much

First of all, I had to relearn Dijkstra + A* and successfully implemented them to solve part 1, this took a long time. But Part 2 introduced constraints and the cart in my code kept crashing outside the bounds of the grid. So I had to throw it away and implement this [solution from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18luw6q/2023_day_17_a_longform_tutorial_on_day_17/) which worked for both parts! I'm proud I solved part 1 all by myself and learned a lot about implementing A*, but couldn't solve this on my own..
