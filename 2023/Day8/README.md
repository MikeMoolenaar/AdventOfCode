# Day 8
- [AoC website](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8)
- Solve time: 1h30m

Had to cheat in this one, I'll try to do better next time, but just couldn't find a solution. I tried brute forcing for 30 mins, but had to use some sort of maths to do it. Started browsing memes on r/adventofcode and someone mentioned LCM without marking spoilers woops. I'm wondering how I could have known about lcmn, need to learn more about math lol.  

rsmith985 executes a solution each day in a single line of C# code. He used `System.Numerics.BigInteger.GreatestCommonDivisor`.
