### Reflection
I tried solving this with regexes and repeating groups, but it was too complicated. Also got a bit confused about when the game is possible or not. Overall not too bad and the code doesn't look ugly in my opinion.

Once again, @encse has a [super nice solution with regexes](https://github.com/encse/adventofcode/blob/master/2023/Day02/Solution.cs#L25). I also tried this, but was spending way too much time splitting the ; seperated games into regex groups, using a regex like `(\d+) red` this is way smarter.
