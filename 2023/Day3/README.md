# Day 3
- [AoC website](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)
- Solve time: 2h15m

### Reflection
Oh my, this was hard. Did not except such a complicated problem on day 3, but I managed. I got stuck on so many off-by-one errors, it's frustrating I should do something about it. Something about the zero based line numbers and char positions really confused me. Next time, I need to draw the part where I get the above or below line that is needed to calculate the position.

And on the third day again, @encse the GOAT [found a cool way](https://github.com/encse/adventofcode/blob/master/2023/Day03/Solution.cs#L41) to calculate if the numbers and symbols are adjacent. I also should have saved the x and y coordinates and calculate it that way, this saves debugging the pesky off-by-one errors. His use of Linq is interesting, I should explore that Linq way more, I mostly use the method based version.
