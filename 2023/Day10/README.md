# Day 10

- Solve time: 5h20m

The hardest one yet, especially part 2 was hard. I did solve part 1 entirely without help, but unfortunely did hack away part 2. Someone on Reddit mentioned that all of the empty spaces inside of the loop are inside a square with a radius of 1/4th of the input size. Counting every non-visited pipe inside the square did give me the solution....  
I'm not proud of it, maybe one day I will truly solve day 10 part 2, but I'm just going to move on for now.
